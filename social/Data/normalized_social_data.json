Okwus has worked at Google for more than 8 years, and in that time he's developed scores of great advice for candidates applying to our technical roles. When asked for one of his top pieces of advice, Okwus advised candidates to brush up on their quantitative skills. \"Counting and probability problems surround us. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory or learning the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics.\"\n\nZooming out, Okwus was also able to share his more general guidance for the interview process. ‚ÄúYou should be able to verbalize and check any assumptions to ensure they are reasonable. This involves asking clarifying questions if you don‚Äôt understand the problem or need more information. Our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. Additionally, be sure to test your own code and ensure it‚Äôs easily readable without bugs. Find problems, write the code and solve them. Ultimately, there's no better way of practicing than actually writing these algorithms.\"\n\nGet the rest of Okwus‚Äôs advice and additional guidance from our recruiting team here ‚Üí goo.gle/4jJ1iM4",

Ensuring accuracy was paramount, particularly with building names and the precise locations of MTR station exits ‚Äì details that are vital in our daily lives.\"\n\nBen's dedication didn't stop there. He's now a Level-9 Local Guide, driven by the pride he feels when navigating his city with Maps. \"Seeing the impact firsthand fuels my passion,\" he says. \"I'm just 8,000 points away from Level 10!\" Ben shares with a smile. \"Every contribution counts, and I'm excited to keep exploring and sharing my love with the community.\"\n\nWe've even unearthed footage of Ben hosting a Google Maps demo in Hong Kong back then!

      "post_text": "Meet Paul, a senior software engineer on the Angular Framework Team in Munich. This #WorldSpinalCordInjuryDay Paul took some time away from contributing to one of Google‚Äôs biggest open-source projects, a framework that powers web apps like Google Cloud to share his story and advice with us:\n\n‚ÄúI had a motorcycle accident in 2020 that caused a severe spinal cord injury. I then started physical therapy and left the hospital with a wheelchair. I'm working hard to re-activate my muscles so that I can stand up and walk with assistance. This was a life-changing situation.\n\nTraveling with a spinal cord injury was scary at the beginning. Most of my team is located in the United States, so my job requires traveling occasionally. When I did eventually need to travel, Google supported me greatly, by allowing my brother to join and make sure I felt good. He was able to bring a larger walking device and my braces.\n\nGoogle also ensured I had the proper setup at home - an ergonomic chair with back support and a standing desk, so I can stand up during meetings, reduce sitting time, and increase overall well-being.\n\nOne of the important aspects of a spinal cord injury I'd like to emphasize is the willingness to improve. You may be getting told numerous times that it's most likely no function will improve after X amount of time. I believe that you should continue to focus on working out; that doesn't necessarily mean working out physically, but can also mean focusing on your mind to connect to your impacted body parts. It's a great feeling, and from my experience can improve things drastically.‚Äù\n\nLearn more about #LifeAtGoogle, our benefits, and our employee resource group, the Disability Alliance ‚Üí https://goo.gle/4egHtJJ",
