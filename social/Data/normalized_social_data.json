Okwus has worked at Google for more than 8 years, and in that time he's developed scores of great advice for candidates applying to our technical roles. When asked for one of his top pieces of advice, Okwus advised candidates to brush up on their quantitative skills. \"Counting and probability problems surround us. Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory or learning the essentials of elementary probability theory and combinatorics.\"\n\nZooming out, Okwus was also able to share his more general guidance for the interview process. “You should be able to verbalize and check any assumptions to ensure they are reasonable. This involves asking clarifying questions if you don’t understand the problem or need more information. Our engineers are looking to see how you engage the problem. Additionally, be sure to test your own code and ensure it’s easily readable without bugs. Find problems, write the code and solve them. Ultimately, there's no better way of practicing than actually writing these algorithms.\"\n\nGet the rest of Okwus’s advice and additional guidance from our recruiting team here → goo.gle/4jJ1iM4",

It was fascinating to see Hong Kong's unique density and community-centric buildings through the lens of mapping. Ensuring accuracy was paramount, particularly with building names and the precise locations of MTR station exits – details that are vital in our daily lives.\"\n\nBen's dedication didn't stop there. He's now a Level-9 Local Guide, driven by the pride he feels when navigating his city with Maps. \"Seeing the impact firsthand fuels my passion,\" he says. \"I'm just 8,000 points away from Level 10!\" Ben shares with a smile. \"Every contribution counts, and I'm excited to keep exploring and sharing my love with the community.\"\n\nWe've even unearthed footage of Ben hosting a Google Maps demo in Hong Kong back then! Check out this video to see how far we've come → https://goo.gle/3QufWug\n\nJoin us in celebrating 20 years of mapping and the dedication of people like Ben who make it all possible.",

Had a great time this morning on stage at #GoogleCloudNext where we unveiled our 7th-gen TPU, Ironwood, purpose-built for inference and with massive gains (3,600x performance and 29x better energy efficiency our first Cloud TPU. It’s coming later this year!)\n\nWe also announced that Cloud Wide Area Network, based on Google’s own global-scale network, is coming soon too. And we launched new features in Google Agentspace that make it easier to create and adopt agents, as well as Gemini 2.5 Flash, our low-latency and most cost-efficient model with “thinking” built-in - coming soon in AI Studio, Vertex + Gemini app. \n\nAI enables powerful new capabilities, but the most exciting part is what people do with them. \n\nI saw an incredible example of that last night at Las Vegas Sphere, where we gave a sneak peek into how AI is helping to enrich the Wizard of Oz experience coming to the Sphere later this year. Google’s been working with visual effects artists around the world and our AI models to effectively bring the film’s original characters to a whole new life for 2025. We’re a company full of engineers, problem solvers…and movie buffs. So the prospect of introducing a classic American film to an entirely new generation was an exciting one!\nMore details on everything we announced at Cloud Next here: https://lnkd.in/eiTnBBp3",

Starting your career alongside a cohort of peers creates a safe space to navigate the challenges we face as young professionals.”\n\nLearn more and apply today ➡️ https://goo.gle/4hruzdM",

Auriel’s core work centers around ensuring AI products are accessible and effective for a wide range of users. “For Detection AI products like Pixel Camera, I make sure that the computer can recognize as many users as possible,” she explained. “For Generative AI products like Gemini, I help build features that keep users safe and improve the quality of the image depictions.”\n\nFor Auriel, her interest in this work was sparked long before she arrived at Google. While completing her computer science capstone research paper in college — where she aimed to detect her heart rate using video signals — Auriel encountered a challenge due to the established model’s inability to register her darker skin tone. “None of my creations could detect my own heart rate accurately, but they could detect my lighter skin toned friends – it was really frustrating.\" Eventually, she solved the issue by creating her own detection model, and this experience ignited her passion for addressing fairness challenges in machine learning.\n\nThank you Auriel for making our products and #lifeatGoogle more fair.

My journey with Google started a few years later in 2018, when I saw a Google office from afar, pointed at it, and told my mom I would work there one day. Two years later, I called her to tell her I got a job offer from Google.”\n\nOutside of her main role as a financial analyst, Stephanie also serves as the VP of Marketing for HOLA Finance: our employee resource group for Latinx finance Googlers. “I’m tasked with ensuring all our Latinx talent in Finance at Google learn about the different resources available to help them grow professionally.” Additionally, Stephanie volunteers at the Association of Latino Professionals for America, and mentors students from across Latin America. “It’s important for me to give back to the community and help our Latinx Googler community become the next leaders of tomorrow.”\n\nAs we celebrate #HispanicHeritageMonth, we’re sharing some of the advice that Stephanie shares with anyone interested in following her footsteps!",

      "post_text": "Meet Paul, a senior software engineer on the Angular Framework Team in Munich. This #WorldSpinalCordInjuryDay Paul took some time away from contributing to one of Google’s biggest open-source projects, a framework that powers web apps like Google Cloud to share his story and advice with us:\n\n“I had a motorcycle accident in 2020 that caused a severe spinal cord injury. I then started physical therapy and left the hospital with a wheelchair. I'm working hard to re-activate my muscles so that I can stand up and walk with assistance. This was a life-changing situation.\n\nTraveling with a spinal cord injury was scary at the beginning. Most of my team is located in the United States, so my job requires traveling occasionally. When I did eventually need to travel, Google supported me greatly, by allowing my brother to join and make sure I felt good. He was able to bring a larger walking device and my braces.\n\nGoogle also ensured I had the proper setup at home - an ergonomic chair with back support and a standing desk, so I can stand up during meetings, reduce sitting time, and increase overall well-being.\n\nOne of the important aspects of a spinal cord injury I'd like to emphasize is the willingness to improve. You may be getting told numerous times that it's most likely no function will improve after X amount of time. I believe that you should continue to focus on working out; that doesn't necessarily mean working out physically, but can also mean focusing on your mind to connect to your impacted body parts. It's a great feeling, and from my experience can improve things drastically.”\n\nLearn more about #LifeAtGoogle, our benefits, and our employee resource group, the Disability Alliance → https://goo.gle/4egHtJJ",

While it required advanced hardware at the time, its influence lives on in task wizards and virtual assistants like Clippy and Cortana. 📎 \n\nBut did you know it also sparked the creation of one of the most recognizable fonts in the world? In 1994, Vincent Connare, working on Microsoft Bob, noticed something odd—Rover the dog was \"speaking\" in Times New Roman. But dogs don’t talk in Times New Roman, he thought. So, he set out to design something more casual, friendly, and hand-drawn. That’s how Comic Sans was born, proving nearly three decades later that design isn’t just about precision—it’s about personality. \n\nRead more: https://msft.it/6001qUPYB #Microsoft50",

      "comment_text": "Hi  This Ugur from The Fix which is a company running in USA and Europe. We have over 200 locations and day by day we are opening new locations. And of course in each time we are creating Google business profile for each location. Up to 2 weeks ago Google was verifying the new created profiles within 24 hours. But now it  takes 7 days. Even before 2025 Google was verifying the profiles as we created. My question is, as the company we are using and paying for Google workspace, we have bulk verification but in spite of these features why do we still have to wait 7 days? What changes before 2 weeks and now? Technology is developing and AI s are being implemented and integrated all work flows ? Why Google is making works harder and slower? Another issue, today I woke up and checked all our profiles and realized that one of them was suspended due to the violation of policy. But we haven’t done any updates even a comma, I submitted a claim . and also 5 GBP asked for video verification. Why? What’s happening in Google? Don’t you think that these are so ridiculous? Warm regards",
